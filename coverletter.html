        <h4>Dear Hiring Manager</h4>
        <h5>This letter is in response to the Software Engineer position.</h5>
        <p>
            <span>As a Master Automotive Technician currently working on heavy-duty equipment for Prince William County Government (PWC), I am excited to apply for this position within your company.  I have been an Automotive Technician for over 10 years. However, I am ready to start a different career path. Since the beginning of 2025, I have enrolled in the Computer Science Bachelor’s degree at Western Governors’ University.</span>
            <span>I have honed my data analyst abilities in the last two years, becoming the lead diagnostics and electrical repair technician.  In addition, I have brought 95% of electronic repairs back in-house rather than outsourcing complex jobs, saving the government thousands of dollars annually. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Using my technical aptitude, creativity, and eagerness to learn, I have thrived in my mechanical career.  Now, I am interested in applying my knowledge in a new arena. </span>
            <span>My unique experience, well-honed soft skills, and ability to work well with others and independently will allow me to make this transition quickly.</span>
            <span>Please review my resume and consider me for this position.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>Thank you,</p>
            <p> Andrew Jones </p>
